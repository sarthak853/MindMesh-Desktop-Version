2. WHEN a user adds a node THEN the system SHALL allow selection of node types including articles, flashcards, multimedia, project ideas, or concepts
3. WHEN a user connects two nodes THEN the system SHALL create a visual relationship link with customizable labels
4. WHEN a user uploads documents or adds web links THEN the system SHALL automatically create corresponding nodes in the cognitive map
5. WHEN a user interacts with a node THEN the system SHALL display contextual information and available actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want AI assistance in two distinct modes (Scholar and Explorer), so that I can get both fact-based cited responses and creative synthesis based on my uploaded materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Scholar Mode THEN the AI SHALL provide fact-based responses with citations grounded in user-uploaded sources
2. WHEN a user selects Explorer Mode THEN the AI SHALL generate creative synthesis and multidisciplinary connections
3. WHEN a user uploads PDFs, notes, or web articles THEN the AI SHALL analyze and index the content for future queries
4. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the AI SHALL access relevant uploaded materials and provide contextually appropriate responses
5. IF the AI cannot find relevant information in uploaded sources THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this limitation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to convert my knowledge into persistent memory cards with spaced repetition scheduling, so that I can improve long-term retention and receive periodic reflection prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects content from notes or documents THEN the system SHALL offer to convert it into memory cards or flashcards
2. WHEN memory cards are created THEN the system SHALL implement spaced-repetition scheduling algorithms
3. WHEN it's time for review THEN the system SHALL send periodic "reflection recall" nudges to the user
4. WHEN a user completes a review session THEN the system SHALL adjust the scheduling based on performance
5. WHEN a user accesses memory tools THEN the system SHALL display progress analytics and retention metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want real-time collaborative editing capabilities for research projects, so that I can work simultaneously with peers on shared documents and discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access a shared project THEN the system SHALL enable real-time collaborative editing
2. WHEN users make changes THEN the system SHALL provide version control with change tracking
3. WHEN a user adds annotations THEN the system SHALL display peer annotations and discussion threads
4. WHEN users share documents THEN the system SHALL maintain a shared document library with access controls
5. WHEN conflicts occur during editing THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want AI-powered conversion of my notes into various media formats, so that I can create custom infographics, podcasts, and explainer videos for different learning preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects notes or content THEN the system SHALL offer conversion options including infographics, podcasts, and videos
2. WHEN generating infographics THEN the system SHALL create visually appealing graphics based on the content structure
3. WHEN creating audio content THEN the system SHALL provide text-to-speech with natural voice options
4. WHEN generating videos THEN the system SHALL create explainer videos with visual elements and narration
5. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL support multilingual output and accessibility features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want a curated inspiration stream that surfaces relevant research and articles, so that I can discover new knowledge aligned with my interests and current projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the inspiration stream THEN the system SHALL display dynamically curated content based on user interests
2. WHEN the system analyzes user behavior THEN it SHALL provide machine-curated suggestions for relevant research and articles
3. WHEN new content is suggested THEN the system SHALL explain the relevance to user's current projects or interests
4. WHEN a user interacts with suggested content THEN the system SHALL learn and refine future recommendations
5. WHEN content is added to the stream THEN the system SHALL ensure quality and relevance filtering

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user focused on well-being, I want a wellness and focus dashboard with productivity tools, so that I can maintain balanced study habits and track my learning activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the wellness dashboard THEN the system SHALL display personalized alerts and activity tracking
2. WHEN a user starts a study session THEN the system SHALL offer Pomodoro timer functionality
3. WHEN break time is recommended THEN the system SHALL provide micro-meditation sessions and wellness prompts
4. WHEN a user completes activities THEN the system SHALL track and visualize progress over time
5. WHEN usage patterns indicate fatigue THEN the system SHALL suggest breaks and wellness activities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure authentication and privacy-compliant data management, so that my personal learning data and collaborative work remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication with role-based access controls
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy regulations and data protection standards
3. WHEN users collaborate THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate access permissions and data isolation
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections and secure protocols
5. IF a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL have monitoring and incident response capabilities
